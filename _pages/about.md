Welcome! I'm excited to have you on my profile. I'm an undergraduate Computer Science major at UC Davis, set to graduate in Spring 2024. My research interests encompass Computer Vision, Multi-Modality Learning, and Domain Adaptations. Currently, I'm focused on Few-Shot Domain Adaptations in Vision-Language Models and MLOps for Neural Network deployment.

I'm currently woring as a Research Assistant with [Prof. Jiawei Zhang](http://jiaweizhang.net/) on Vision-Language Models and interning at a Computer Vision Startup specializing in Coffee Analytics, led by [Prof. William Ristenpart](https://coffeecenter.ucdavis.edu/people/william-ristenpart). I've also gained valuable experience in Multi-Modality Learning in Medical Imaging as a research assistant under [Prof. Chen-Nee Chuah](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~chuah/rubinet/people/chuah/bio.html).

Outside of my research life, I earned my Q certification in 2020, officially recognizing my ability to assess Specialty Coffee quality worldwide. I've also had the privilege of taking enlightening courses with [Prof. Omnia El Shakry](https://www.omniaelshakry.com/), which have nurtured my curiosity and refined my skills in delving into original research.

  We are building a mobile app that can assess the quality of coffee beans using Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

* **[DeepCoffee](https://andy-lzh.github.io/DeepCoffee/)**  
  DeepCoffee is a project that aims to predict the flavors of coffee beans using GPT-3 text-davinci-002. I am responsible for the development of the model and the deployment.
