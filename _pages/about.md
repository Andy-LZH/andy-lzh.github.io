Welcome! I'm thrilled that you've landed on my page. As a rising senior majoring in Computer Science, I'm on track to graduate in Spring 2024. I currently hold the role of Software Engineering Lead and am a founding member of RoastPic, a Computer Vision Startup established by Prof. William Ristenpart. Moreover, I have gained valuable experience as a research assistant in the field of Multi-Modality Learning in Medical Imaging, working under the guidance of Prof. Chen-Nee Chuah.

My research interests lie in the areas of Computer Vision, Multi-Modality Learning, and Semi-Supervised Learning. Presently, my focus is centered around Few-Shot Domain Adaptations in Vision-Language Models, where I aim to bridge the gap between different domains using limited labeled data.
