Welcome! I'm thrilled that you've discovered my page. As a undergraduate student majoring in CS at UC Davis, I will be graduated in Spring 2024. My research interests lie in the areas of Computer Vision, Multi-Modality Learning, and Semi-Supervised Learning. Presently, my focus is centered around Few-Shot Domain Adaptations in Vision-Language Models, and MLOps that bring Neural Networks to production.

I currently hold the role of Software Engineering Lead and am a founding member of RoastPic, a Computer Vision Startup established by [Prof. William Ristenpart](https://coffeecenter.ucdavis.edu/people/william-ristenpart). And concurrently Research Assistant at UC Davis Coffee Center with Prof. Ristenpart. Moreover, I have gained valuable experience as a research assistant in the field of Multi-Modality Learning in Medical Imaging, working under the guidance of [Prof. Chen-Nee Chuah](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~chuah/rubinet/people/chuah/bio.html).

Beyond my professional life, I achieved Q certification in 2020, allowing me to officially assess the cup quality of Specialty Coffee worldwide. I have also been fortunate to participate in captivating classes brought by [Prof. Omnia El Shakry](https://www.omniaelshakry.com/), which have fueled my curiosity while honing my ability to deep dive into original theses.
