I'm a first-year PhD student at CU Boulder in the IVC Group, advised by [Prof. Danna Gurari](https://dannagurari.colorado.edu/). My research focuses on Computer Vision and Multi-Modal Learning, and I'm working on expand visual grounding to video and 3D spatial spaces to improve accessibility for people with visual impairments.

Before I came to boulder, I co-founded [RoastPic](https://www.roastpic.com/) with [Prof. William Ristenpart](https://coffeecenter.ucdavis.edu/people/william-ristenpart) and our [wonderful team](https://www.roastpic.com/about-us). And I'm very proud that we brought the first Mobile App that able to do roast level analysis of coffee beans. I also had a great time in Davis where [Prof. Jiawei Zhang](http://jiaweizhang.net/) showed me what research was like and also advised me in research in Vision-language models and Video Quality.

Beyond my research, I earned my Q certification in 2020, which recognize the ability to assess quality of specialty coffee worldwide. I'm also pretty boulder sterotype where I spent a lot of time in the mountains hiking and skiing.
